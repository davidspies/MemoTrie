*MemoTrie* is functional library for creating efficient memo functions, using [tries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie").
It's based on some code from Spencer Janssen (originally put on hpaste.org, now expired), which I assume was based on Ralf Hinze's paper [*Memo functions, polytypically!*](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.43.3272 "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.43.3272").

Build with with `stack build`.
